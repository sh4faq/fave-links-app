# Fav Links App

Simple React app for storing favorite links. Made for my web dev assignment.

## What it does

- Shows a table with your links
- Add new links 
- Delete links
- Click URLs to open them

## Running it

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

## Tech

- React (class components)
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS for styling (extra credit)

## Notes

Using class components because that's what the assignment wanted. State is in LinkContainer and passed down as props.

Had to fix the vite config because it was showing too many IP addresses at first.
